### 🧱 Cloud Computing Service Models

### 1. 🔧 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

| Feature          | Description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| You manage       | OS, apps, data                        |
| Provider manages | Hardware, network, virtualization     |
| Examples         | Azure VMs, Amazon EC2, Google Compute |

✅ **Use when**: You want maximum control over your environment (e.g., virtual machines, networking, storage).

---

### 2. 🛠️ Platform as a Service (PaaS)

> Provides hardware and software tools over the internet for application development.

| Feature           | Description                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| You manage        | Applications, data                            |
| Provider manages  | OS, servers, storage, networking              |
| Examples          | Azure App Services, Google App Engine, Heroku |

✅ **Use when**: You want to build apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

---

### 3. 🧩 Software as a Service (SaaS)

> Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

| Feature          | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| You manage       | Just use the application                    |
| Provider manages | Everything else                             |
| Examples         | Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce |

✅ **Use when**: You need a ready-to-use software product with minimal setup.

## 🌍 Cloud Deployment Models

### 1. 🌐 Public Cloud
- Services delivered over the public internet.
- Shared resources among multiple customers.
- Providers: Azure, AWS, Google Cloud.

### 2. 🏢 Private Cloud
- Cloud infrastructure operated exclusively for a single organization.
