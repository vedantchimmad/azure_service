# ✅ Exists Transformation in Azure Data Factory (ADF) Data Flow

---

## 📌 Introduction
The **Exists Transformation** in ADF Data Flows is used to **filter rows** in one stream based on whether they exist (or do not exist) in another stream.  
It works like a **semi-join** or **anti-join** in SQL.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Compares **two datasets/streams**.  
- Returns rows from the **left stream** based on existence in the **right stream**.  
- Supports **two modes**:
  - **Exists** → Keep rows that **exist** in the right stream.  
  - **Does Not Exist** → Keep rows that **do not exist** in the right stream.  
- Efficient for **filtering and deduplication scenarios**.

## 🛠️ Configuration Properties

| Property         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Left Stream**  | The primary dataset (input rows to filter). |
| **Right Stream** | The dataset used to check existence. |
| **Join Conditions** | Columns to match between left and right streams. |
| **Exists Mode**  | `Exists` (semi-join) or `Does Not Exist` (anti-join). |

## 📊 Example 1: Keep Only Existing Records
**Scenario:** Keep only customers who have orders.  

```sql
-- Equivalent SQL
SELECT c.*
FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
);
````

📌 Data Flow Configuration:

* **Left Stream**: Customers
* **Right Stream**: Orders
* **Join Condition**: `CustomerID`
* **Mode**: Exists

➡️ Result: Only customers **with at least one order**.

---

## 📊 Example 2: Filter Out Existing Records

**Scenario:** Get customers **without any orders**.

```sql
-- Equivalent SQL
SELECT c.*
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
);
```

📌 Data Flow Configuration:

* **Left Stream**: Customers
* **Right Stream**: Orders
* **Join Condition**: `CustomerID`
* **Mode**: Does Not Exist

➡️ Result: Customers **with no orders**.

## 📊 Example 3: Deduplication with Exists

**Scenario:** Filter out records from staging that already exist in the master table.

📌 Data Flow Steps:

1. **Source1 (StagingData)**
2. **Source2 (MasterData)**
3. **Exists Transformation** → Match on `PrimaryKey`.
4. **Mode**: Does Not Exist.
5. Output → Only new records are kept for insertion.

---

## 🚀 Workflow Example

**Use Case:** Load only new customers into the master table.

1. **Source1** → Staging Customers.
2. **Source2** → Master Customers.
3. **Exists (Does Not Exist)** → Keep only new rows.
4. **Sink** → Insert into Master Table.

Diagram:

```
(Staging Customers) → Exists (check against Master Customers) → New Customers Only → Sink
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

* Use **Exists** for filtering based on membership in another dataset.
* Use **Does Not Exist** for **incremental loads** (avoiding duplicates).
* Optimize join conditions for **performance** (use indexed keys).
* For large datasets, consider **Broadcast join hints** to improve efficiency.

---

## 🏆 Key Takeaways

* **Exists Transformation** is a **filtering operation** between two streams.
* Works like **semi-join (Exists)** and **anti-join (Does Not Exist)**.
* Useful for **validations, deduplication, and incremental loads**.
* Helps build **efficient and clean ETL pipelines** in ADF.
